# WGX v1-stable

This release marks the transition of WGX to a Bash-only toolchain.

## Key Changes

- **Bash-only:** WGX is now a pure Bash tool, removing the need for a Rust toolchain.
- **Standardized Profiles:** All repositories now use a standardized `.wgx/profile.yml` file.
- **Unified CI:** Reusable GitHub Actions workflows have been implemented to streamline CI across all repositories.
- **Fleet-Mechanisms:** The toolchain has been consolidated and simplified.
